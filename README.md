## About Digital Linguistics

Digital Linguistics (DLx) is the science of the digital management, storage, and dissemination of linguistic data. Best practice in Digital Linguistics is to use the modern open web platform - primarily HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & JSON - for working with linguistic data. DLx projects aim to accommodate the ways linguists already think about and work with their data, and to provide an interoperable data format and set of tools for linguists to use. DLx projects are entirely open source, and aim for simplicity such that other collaborators in the community can contribute to any DLx project.
