# General Contributing Guidelines for DLx Projects

## Code of Conduct

DLx projects follow a Code of Conduct, available [here][1].

## DLx Style Library

DLx has its own [style library][2], containing LESS stylesheets and other assets for components used across DLx projects. DLx styles are based on the default [Semantic UI][3] theme. In most cases, DLx projects use the [LESS distribution][4] of Semantic UI, so that only the styles for individual components need to be included in a project, rather than the entire Semantic UI library.

## Contributor Roles

DLx uses three separate roles for managing project contributors:

1. `maintainer` - Responsible for code review, general direction, and high-level decisions for a project. 2-4 people per project. Maintainers (and admins) are the only people who can push to the `master` branch in a project.

1. `developer` - A person with commit access to DLx repositories. Anyone who makes a contribution to a DLx project and has their pull request merged is automatically added to the DLx Developers team on GitHub, and is given write access to all DLx repositories (pushes to the `master` branch will still be restricted to maintainers and admins).

1. `contributor` - Anyone who contributes to DLx in any way, whether by opening an issue, joining discussion on GitHub, or publishing / presenting on Digital Linguistics.
